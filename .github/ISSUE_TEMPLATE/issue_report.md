**1. Issue Title**

* A good title should include the key components of the issue, such as the error code, the affected system, and the action causing it.
  * Example: "Error 500: Internal Server Error when deploying Flask app to Heroku"

**2. Provide Context**

* What were you trying to do? Explain the task, process, or goal you were working on.
  * _Example:_ "I was trying to deploy a Python Flask application to Heroku using the Heroku CLI."
* Where is the issue occurring? Specify the environment or platform (e.g., operating system and software version).
  * _Example:_ "The issue is occurring on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10."

**3. Error Message**

* Copy and paste the exact error message and screenshot it. Avoid paraphrasing the error message.
  * _Example:_ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_sqlalchemy'
Use formatting tools to improve readability, e.g., enclosing the message using 3 back-tick symbols **```** to form a code block

**4. Detail your Setup**

Include relevant system or application details such as:

* Operating system: _Example:_ Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (version 10, Build 26100)
* Software versions: _Example:_ "Python 3.10.7, Flask 2.3.1"

* List steps or solutions you have already attempted, including their outcomes.
  * _Example:_ "I installed `flask_sqlalchemy` using `pip install flask_sqlalchemy`, but the error persists after restarting the server."
* The aim is to avoid making others suggest solutions you have already ruled out.

**6. Attach Supporting Information**

* Logs: Include relevant sections of logs, using a code block to preserve formatting.
* Code snippets: Share relevant portions of code. **Make sure the code is minimal** and replicates the issue.
* Configurations: Share configuration files or settings related to the problem.
* Screenshots: Use sparingly, only when visuals are more informative than text.

**7. Ask Specific Questions**

* Clearly state what you want help with:
  * _Example:_ "How can I resolve this module error?"
  * _Example:_ "What steps can I take to debug a 500 error on Heroku?"
